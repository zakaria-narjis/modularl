    init():
        Initialize the agent.
    observe(batch_obs, batch_actions, batch_rewards, batch_next_obs, batch_dones):
        Observe the environment and store the transition in the replay buffer.
    act_train(batch_obs):
        Select an action for training.
    act_eval(obs):
        Select an action for evaluation.
    update():
        Perform a training update.

            - The shapes assume a vectorized environment. For a single environment, batch_size would typically be 1.
