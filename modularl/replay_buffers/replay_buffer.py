    A replay buffer for storing and sampling transitions for reinforcement learning.

    Attributes:
        storage (LazyMemmapStorage): The storage object for storing transitions.

        sample(batch_size): Sample a batch of transitions from the buffer.
        extend(transition): Add a transition to the buffer.
