Welcome to ModulaRL Documentation
=================================

**Note: ModulaRL is currently under construction.**

ModulaRL is a highly modular and extensible reinforcement learning library built on PyTorch. It aims to provide researchers and developers with a flexible framework for implementing, experimenting with, and extending various RL algorithms.

Features
---------
- **Modular Architecture**: Allows easy component swapping and extension.
- **Efficient Implementations**: Leverages PyTorch's capabilities for optimal performance.
- **Integration with TorchRL**: Provides optimized replay buffers and utilities.
- **Clear Documentation and Examples**: Offers a quick start for users.
- **Designed for Research and Practical Applications**: Facilitates fast and custom prototyping for researchers with or without RL experience.
