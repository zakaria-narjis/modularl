ModulaRL is a highly modular and extensible reinforcement learning library built on PyTorch. It aims to provide researchers and developers with a flexible framework for implementing, experimenting with, and extending various RL algorithms.

## Features

- Modular architecture allowing easy component swapping and extension
- Efficient implementations leveraging PyTorch's capabilities
- Integration with TorchRL for optimized replay buffers
- Clear documentation and examples for quick start
- Designed for both research and practical applications in reinforcement learning
